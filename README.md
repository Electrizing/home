## About me
Hey, I'm a programmer with 5+ years of experience, I mostly code in Lua, Python, and JavaScript.

I have made a lot of projects in Roblox Studio, mostly for fun. However, I own a game with 3M+ visits.

## Payment
Pay with PayPal here: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FFVQP9279E7AJ
Accepting primarily PayPal. If you use a different payment method, such as CashApp, maybe I could accept that too. 

Please be reasonable with prices.

I prefer for you to offer prices, I'll give you a heads-up if it's too low.

Make sure to take care of fees.

## About me
Hey, I am a programmer with 4+ years of experience, mostly LUA, Python, JavaScript and C#.

I made a lot of projects in Roblox Studio (50+), mostly for fun.

## Payment
I only accept Robux.

Please be reasonable with the prices, for example, I can't make you a whole game for 1k.

I prefer for you to offer prices, I'll give you a heads-up if it's too low.

Make sure to take care of tax.

## Past work
Sorry if videos are low quality.

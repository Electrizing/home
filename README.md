## About me
Hey, I'm a programmer with 4+ years of experience, I mostly code in LUA, Python, JavaScript and C#.

I have made a lot of projects in Roblox Studio (50+), mostly for fun.

## Payment
I only accept Robux.

Please be reasonable with the prices, for example, I can't make you a whole game for 1,000 Robux.

I prefer for you to offer prices, I'll give you a heads-up if it's too low.

Make sure to take care of tax.

## Past work
